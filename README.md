# Alcohol-Detection-and-Seat-Belt-Locking-System-in-Vehicle

Abstract

The aim of our project is to prevent vehicle driving at the time of alcohol drink, which makes human driving safer, and to overcome accidents. This project is developed by integrating alcohol sensor with NE555 IC and transistor ckt. the alcohol sensor used in this project is MQ3 which to detect the alcohol content in human breath. Since sensor has fine sensitivity, it can suit to any vehicle and can easily be hidden from the suspects. This project is fitted inside the vehicle. The project is designed for the safety of people sitting inside the vehicle.

1.      Alcohol sensor

2.      Al frame of vehicle

3.      Battery

4.      Transformer

5.      Dc battery

6.      Controller

7.      Wheels

8.      Plywood

9.      Seat belt

10.  Dc motors

# Problem Statement

 Drunken driving is considered as one of the major reason of accidents in worldwide. Drivers under the influence of alcohol show a clear failure of perception recognition and vehicle control. Therefore, by this accident occurs.

 # Proposed System

Alcohol detection in vehicle system is continuously growing over years, which could resolve drunken driving accidents worldwide.

# Advantages

1.      To prevent accident due to drunk and driving.

2.      Also prevent serious injury by seat belt locking compulsory

3.       Easy and efficient to test the alcohol content in the body.

4.      Quick and accurate results.

5.      Helpful for police and provides and automatic safety systems for cars and other vehicles

# Applications

1.      “Alcohol detector project” can be used in the various vehicles for detecting whether the driver as consumed alcohol or not.

2.      This project use seat belt locking compulsory then and then vehicle will start

3.      This project can also be used in various companies or organizations to detect alcohol consumptions of employees and locking of seat belt.
